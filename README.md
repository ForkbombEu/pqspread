# PQSpread

Serveless (and offline) encrypt and exchange files using asymetric PQC. Works by opening a single html file in the browser, download from the [releases](https://github.com/ForkbombEu/pqspread/releases) and double click on it!

PQSpread is a quantum-safe file encryption and decryption tool that leverages the ML-KEM-512 (FIPS-203) algorithm combined with AES-GCM to ensure security against quantum threats. This application is built entirely in-house using the cutting-edge Zenroom virtual machine, providing a secure, client-side solution with no remote data storage required.

## Features

- **Quantum-Safe Encryption**: Uses ML-KEM-512 (FIPS-203) + AES-GCM for robust security.
- **Client-Side Operations**: All cryptographic operations are performed on the client side, ensuring no data is stored remotely.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple interface for encrypting and decrypting files.
- **Offline Mode**: Download a single HTML file to run the application offline.

## Usage

### Online Mode

You can use PQSpread online by visiting [this link](https://forkbomb.eu/pqspread).

### Offline Mode

For offline and paranoid mode, download the single HTML file from [GitHub](https://github.com/forkbombeu/pqspread) and run it on your machine.

## How to Use

When loading the page, it automatically generates a **secret key** and the corresponding **public key**. Both are stored in the browser storage, if you refresh the webpage the keys won't change. You need to use PQSpread to generate these keys and you must share your public key with peers if you want to receive encrypted files. If you delete the browser storage / clear browsing history then the keys will be deleted. If you wish to generate a new secret/public key, use CTRL + F5 in browser

1. **Encrypt a File**:
   - Click the "Encrypt" button
   - Paste the recipient's public key into the text box below it
   - You will be prompted to select the file to encrypt, click the 'Choose file' button
   - If the file type and the public key provided are correct a 'Download PQS file' button will appear
   - Download the encrypted file ending with .pqs to share with the recipient

2. **Decrypt a File**:
   - Click the "Decrypt" button
   - Click the 'Choose file' button and select the .pqs file you wish to decrypt
   - If the file is decryption is valid a 'Download decrypted file' button will appear
   - Clicking on button will download a file called `decryped.file` to your device
  
note: the original filename is not preserved during the encryption/decryption process


## Public Key

Your public key can be shared with others to receive encrypted files. Copy it from the application interface.
